# Instructions

Now that you are all setup, let's write our first bot and explore the code.

* Open Visual Studio 2017.

* Create new C# project from the installed templates.

* Choose the Bot application template.

By now, you should have a project with all the necessary components. Just make sure you have the latest SDK:
Project --> Manage Nuget Packages --> update Microsoft.Bot.Builder
